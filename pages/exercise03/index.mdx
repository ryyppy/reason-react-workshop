# Exercise 03 - Doing interop between ReasonReact / ReactJS components

> TODO

## Tips

- `.mdx` files are JavaScript land. Always make sure to use `genType` for automatically converting ReasonReact components to ReactJS components.
- Use `[@genType]` annotations on `make` functions to make a ReasonReact component importable in JavaScript
- Check out `layout/layout.re` to find out how to use CSS-Modules in Reason (`<div className=style##root` />)
- Also check out already existing components if you are stuck on certain things

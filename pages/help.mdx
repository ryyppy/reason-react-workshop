# Help

Here are some hints on how to work with this Antwar setup.

- Edit `antwar.config.js` to add routes
- Edit `webpack.config.js` to modify webpack behavior

## Interactive Components

Whenever you want to use a stateful (Reason)React component, you need to use an
Interactive component to mark them as separate build units. Antwar will detect
given components, build separate bundles and hooks them up via script injection.

**This is a JS based Counter:**

<Interactive id="components/infra/Counter.js" component={Counter} count={5} />

**This is a Reason based Counter:**
<Interactive id="components/infra/ReCounter.re.js" component={ReCounter} count={5} />

## Smoke Testing Production builds

Use `npm run build` or `npm run clean-build` (clean-build doesn't work on Windows yet) to build your project. For easy
testing on your local machine, you can do:

```sh
cd build/
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

Now you can access your built website on `localhost:8000`. This is the
actual build you also deploy on your hosting server.

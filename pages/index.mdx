# ReasonReact Workshop Exercises

This repository has a set of exercises to get familiar with Reason & ReasonReact.<br />
Open this project in `vscode` for the best Reason editing experience (works for Linux, MacOS & Windows).

You will also need the `reason-vscode` plugin by `Jared Forsyth` installed to have autocompletion and syntax-highlighting.
